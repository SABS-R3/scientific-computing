The course material is broken up into days, each focusing on an individual topic. Each 
days topic is supported by at least one pre-recorded lecture to introduce the topic, 
accompanied by the written material in the website that covers the mathematical 
background of details of each algorithm covered. At certain points in the material, 
practical exercises are given to consolidate your understanding and to further develop 
practical skills in algorithm implementation using Python.

This is an example problem. Each problem is followed by a hidden solution for your

solution, or if you are stuck and cannot proceed.
