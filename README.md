# Scientific Computing in MATLAB

An online course on Scientific Computing in MATLAB for the Oxford Doctoral Training Centre http://www.dtc.ox.ac.uk/.


## Hugo

This course is built from Markdown content using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hugo Learn theme](https://learn.netlify.app/en/).

### Ubuntu quickstart for contributions

1. Get hugo.
    I recommend getting Hugo from snap so you get an up-to-date version:

    ```bash
    sudo snap install hugo
    ```

1. Clone this repo, and navigate to the `hugo_site` directory

1. Run `hugo server`, and follow the link to view the site in your browser

1. Edit content in the `hugo_site/content` directory, on a new branch, and open a pull request on GitHub.
